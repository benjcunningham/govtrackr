# govtrackr 0.1.0

* Initializes basic library wrapping the GovTrack API. It provides access to the service's eight data resources by mirroring the core options of the system.

* New `fetch_govtrack()` is a convenient function for querying the service. It rearranges its parameters into a properly-formed request and returns the resulting JSON structure as a data frame.
